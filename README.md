# Smart-Parking

# Abstract
These days finding a parking slot is very difficult in major cities due to large vehicle population and lack of parking place. So smart parking system has been implemented, but these only monitor the local areas in metropolitan cities. So, we want to implement a system that can collect data of all parking slots in a city and can enable then to book by an people from the user interface, cloud will mediate between user interface and hardware systems. The main part we are implementing is enabling to book parking slot in the given city, this is the one which is novel in our project.
